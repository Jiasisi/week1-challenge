# week1-challenge

## Description
I have refactored the Index.html and CSS file to make them meet the requirements. 
1.  In the source code, I added more semantic HTML elements to make the CSS file structure looks more clear. 
2. I tried to make HTML elements follow a logical structure according to styling and positioning.
3. I added some description words into the alt attributes.
4. I added the described words into the title element.
5. I created a repo for this challenge and used git commands to upload my files to the github. 
6. I deployed the pages that I refactored.
